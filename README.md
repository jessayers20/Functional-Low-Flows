1. Calculate low flow metrics

Script 1_Calculate_low_flow_metrics_dry_season

Calculates the minimum 7-day moving average, minimum 7-day occurence date, number of zero flow days, start of first no flow day, flow duration curve metrics.
These metrics are calculated for all reference CA stream gages included in the California Environmental Flows Framework. Script takes daily discharge data downloaded from USGS and calculates metrics over the CA dry season (June 1-December 31).
